# How to compile / run
* There shouldnt be any dependancies other than a rust toolchian
* Probably get rustup and use that to install cargo etc.
* Might need nightly rust (`rustup default nightly`?)
  * Im sorry, the only thing nightly is for is casting arrays of float to arrays of u8 for openGL which shouldnt be so hard but it is
 * cargo run --release

 # How to play
 * WASD movement
 * QE flip through spellbook
 * left click to cast current spell
 * Escape quit, R reset
